Builds a table of contents from documents in subfolders in google drive
Add this script to the table of contents (tools -> script editor) and either run it manually through the menu or automatically (such as every hour, etc.)

Example:

Table of Contents document <-- Script goes here
Some Notes
 - Something
 - Something else
Some other Notes
  - Something else 2
  - Something else 3
  
 This will create categories for Some Notes and Some other Notes, with each file under them added to their category
